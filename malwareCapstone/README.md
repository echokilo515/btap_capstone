# Capstone Malware Analysis

Python script reads a list of md5 hashes in a text file and uploads each hash to virus total using API calls to check for known malicious signatures. the output of each API response is handled via the program. Status Code 200 (signature detected) hashes are written to a text file with the json output. hashes that didnt flag (response code 400) provide a terminal message that the hash is clean and iterates to the next hash.
